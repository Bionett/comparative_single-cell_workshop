# Comparative scRNAseq analysis
This hands-on session guides the participants along the data analysis workflow to identify cellular compositional changes and cell-type-specific differentially expressed genes starting from transcript count matrices of a public [dataset](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE157783) 
with multiple samples from two clinical conditions.  

## Dataset
This [study](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/145/3/964/6469020) sequenced over 40.000 nuclei from 11 human midbrain samples, 5 Parkinson's disease (PD) and 6 control. The authors identified 12 major cell population making up the human midbrain.

## Aim
Identify the cellular & gene expression changes in the PD midbrain.
